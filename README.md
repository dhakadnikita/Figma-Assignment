# Figma Assignment - React (Minimal)
This is a minimal React + Vite starter project that reproduces the Figma layout's right-side widgets:
- About widget with tabs
- Gallery widget with add-image and navigation

How to run:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

Notes:
- This is intentionally minimal and uses plain CSS to approximate the design.
- Replace with Tailwind or Next.js as needed.
